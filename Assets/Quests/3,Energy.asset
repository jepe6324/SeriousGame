  rewardText: "<b>On your way to the waterfall, you came across a merchant with a
    huge backpack. He stopped and talked to you as you both took a moment\u2019s
    break on your travels. But it was eventually time to leave, and you wandered
    back to the road together. Before you parted ways, he offered you part of his
    supply: a small jar of exotic spices. You thanked him, and returned to your travels.
    Intrigued, you took out your lunch and used some of the spice. Your eyes widened,
    the taste was unbelievable! You kept pouring more, but the taste was never overwhelming.
    Once dinner came, the process was repeated with the same effect.  <br><br> As
    the day came to a close, you took out the third and final snack you had brought
    and tried pouring more of the spice on it. Only a little came out, much to your
    dismay. You looked in the jar to see if it was possible to scrape some off the
    sides. It was nearly empty, but there still seemed to be a lump of spice at the
    bottom. You reached in to break it apart, but it was as hard as stone. Taking
    it out and dusting it off, you noticed that it wasn\u2019t a lump of spice at
    all, but a crystal! You figured the crystal must\u2019ve been the secret ingredient
    that made it so flavourful.  </b> "
