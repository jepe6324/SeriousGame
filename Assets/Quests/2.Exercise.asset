  rewardText: "<b>Wham! Your wooden training sword hit your opponent square in the
    stomach. He fell to the ground but swiftly bounced back on his feet. \u201CWow,
    I really stood no chance!\u201D, he exclaimed in a surprisingly excited tone
    in his voice, especially for a man who was just struck to the ground. \u201CNever
    in my life have I seen a technique like yours! There\u2019s no doubt in my heart
    that you are capable of winning the Tournament of Blades. That\u2019s not to
    say that you should let down your guard of course, I was merely your first opponent!\u201D. 
    <br> Opponent after opponent bit the dust as your blade danced across the arena.
    Only the final battle remained, and judging by the cheers it was far from being
    a nobody.  <br><br> Thump! Thump! Thump! The ground shook as the footsteps of
    this beast of a man approached you. Before you knew it he towered over you, and
    you could see that he was built like an ox. He grinned from ear to ear, then
    brought down his sword. Or well, referring to it as a sword was almost a stretch,
    it looked more like he had cut down a small tree, sharpened the edges and said
    \u201Cdone\u201D. You decided that the best thing to do would be to finish this
    quickly, so before he had any time to react you dashed towards his weapon and
    leaped onto it to get aerial momentum. You braced your sword arm for impact,
    but as you did his free arm swung through the air, attempting to swat you down.
    Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, you grabbed ahold of his forearm, swung yourself
    around and kicked yourself off of it. The force of your kick accelerated you
    towards his knee, and a well-aimed strike at the back of his knee later, he was
    felled. But you had no time to spare, so you jumped towards his head, using his
    firm chest for an extra boost. A split second your sword whipped through the
    air, and - bam! The blade dug deeply into the sand next to his face.  <br><br>
    Victory was yours, and the first place price: the crystal, was safe in the grasp
    of your hand. </b> "
