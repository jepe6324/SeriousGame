  rewardText: '<b>As you entered the city, there seemed to be some sort of event
    going on based on the sheer amount of people on the streets. Many families seemed
    to be in a rush as they pushed their way through the crowd. There was however
    one child who caught your attention, for she was alone, and standing quite a
    ways off from everyone else. You approached her and asked if she was lost, and
    she said she ran away because what her parents had been doing was boring. At
    first you tried to convince her that you could help finding them, but she was
    clearly quite stubborn. So instead you decided to sit down with her, telling
    tales of your brave exploits. Everything from finding magical creatures and hidden
    shrines to seasonal events with your friends. The little girl stared at you in
    awe as she heard tale after tale of things she thought were mere fairy tales.
    It took a while, but her parents eventually came for her with a worried look
    on their faces. They were quickly caught up to speed and they thanked you from
    the bottom of their hearts for looking over their daughter. Before they left,
    the girl ran up to you, told you to reach out your hand, and in it she placed
    a crystal. </b> '
