  rewardText: "<b>\u201CWhy hello again, best friend o\u2019 mine! I didn\u2019t
    expect to see you so soon!\u201D, exclaimed Spoons as you entered the inn where
    the two of you resided. \u201CMissed me already? Oh there\u2019s really no need
    to explain, I have that effect on people.\u201D, he continued without missing
    a beat. He waited for you to sit down next to him, then carried on, \u201CI may
    be weaker than I once was, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can underestimate me.
    Not even dragon\u2019s are a match for me, and I\u2019m starting to think that
    their fear of me is why I\u2019ve never encountered one myself. Not surprising,
    since with you on my team I\u2019ll be back to my former self in no-time!\u201D
    He struck a few poses and grinned as though he just accomplished a grand feat,
    then sat down again. There was silence for a few seconds before he continued,
    \u201CI\u2026 don\u2019t take what you do for granted, you know? Seeing your
    efforts made me go out into the world myself to find crystals. I may not be as
    strong as you are, but I promise to catch up with soon, then we\u2019ll be partners
    for real!\u201D<br> He then went over to the chest where he keeps his crystals,
    took one out and said, \u201CI know it\u2019s supposed to be the other way around,
    but you took the time to meet me today, and I don\u2019t know any other way of
    showing my appreciation\u2026 so here you go. I\u2019ll prepare something better
    next time!\u201D </b> "
