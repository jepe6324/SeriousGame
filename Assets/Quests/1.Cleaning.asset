  rewardText: "\u201CLaundry day! Laundry day!\u201D, the village children exclaimed
    while skipping about. You exited the inn to see most of the village gathered
    with baskets of clothes and large buckets of water. The mother of the children
    you had previously heard hushed them and whispered something in their ears. After
    a few seconds the entire village seemed to have gone silent. The silence was
    held for mere moments before singing and laughter erupted from not only the children,
    but the adults and elderly too. With smiles on their faces and hips swinging
    to the beat of a newly arrived drummer, they grouped up in a long row.  <br><br>
    \u201CHey, ho! Hey, ho! Laundry day is here, hey! Cleaning\u2019s what we do,
    ho!\u201D <br><br> The children handed the baskets of dirty clothes to each other,
    moving them towards the elderly who then cleaned them in the buckets, before
    letting the adults hang the clothes up to dry. A smile creeped up on your face,
    and your heart warmed up thinking about how they made a normally dull task into
    something truly fun. It didn\u2019t take long for you to join them, and welcoming
    they were indeed. Once all clothes had been hung up on the long strings the woman
    next to you gave you a big bear hug, thanking you for your help. In your hand
    she left you a crystal, and you realised that maybe laundry day wasn\u2019t that
    bad after all. </b> "
