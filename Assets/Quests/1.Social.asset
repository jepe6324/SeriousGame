  rewardText: "<b>Standing at the edges of the city, you couldn\u2019t help but get
    a feeling of awe. The tall brick walls encompassed it in its entirety apart from
    two guarded roads in and out. Only the capitol building was visible from the
    outside, towering over the rest of the city. The streets were certainly busy,
    with food stands, jewelers and tailors stretching from one side of the city to
    another. Avoiding the temptation of joining the mass was quite difficult, but
    you eventually snapped out of it and pushed through the crowd.  <br><br> On the
    other side was your goal: the blacksmith. He was a burly man with a light layer
    of coal over his face. Half the shop was a weapon-shop run by his daughter. She
    showed you a wide array of different blades, some as light as a feather, others
    heavy enough to cleave through a tree. It would be a mesmerising place for any
    swordsman, and you were certainly no exception. At long last, you held in your
    hand what you saw as nothing less than the perfect sword. The grip comfortably
    rested in your hand, encompassed by the guard and pommel as though it was made
    for you. It was an instant purchase, and both you and the clerk naturally couldn\u2019t
    be more satisfied. Only the test remained - one can\u2019t leave a blacksmith\u2019s
    without testing a blade\u2019s merit after all. You were told that no-one had
    been able to cut through the boulder behind you, so that is - of course - what
    you decided to do. A well-aimed strike later and the boulder was two, and to
    your surprise you saw something glimmer inside\u2026 As you picked it up you
    immediately recognised the familiar sight of a crystal! The clerk let you keep
    it as a gift for being the first to ever cut through the boulder. </b> "
