  rewardText: "<b>The villagers finally had enough. Goblins had been residing on
    the outskirts of the forest for weeks now, and their trails were far from discreet.
    Dirty fabrics, broken jars, and rusted weapons were spread out far and wide.
    \u201CThis has got to come to an end!\u201D, the villagers all agreed on. With
    your help they effortlessly devised a plan to chase off the goblins and clean
    up the forest. Your role was to furiously wave your sword around while using
    all the tricks at your disposal: the fancier the better. The plan worked without
    a hitch, for the goblins were too afraid to approach despite their numbers. Some
    ran at the first sight of someone with a blade, others feigned courage for as
    long as they could muster, though they all inevitably ran away. Then it was the
    villagers' turn, and they had prepared several huge sacks to hold as much waste
    as possible. It was several hours of labour, but with everyone\u2019s combined
    help the forest was soon as clean as before the goblins had taken up camp. Once
    the day was over the organisers handed a crystal to you as a thank you for your
    help in dealing with the goblin menace.  </b> "
