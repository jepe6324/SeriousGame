  rewardText: "<b>The tournaments up in the mountains were popular amongst races
    of all kinds, but they had always been separated so that humans fought humans,
    goblins fought goblins and so on. But this year was different, for the races
    actually came together to host the biggest tournament yet, and all the winners
    from other tournaments would be there! You were invited as the champion of mankind,
    an invitation you would hardly deny. To climb your way to the top, you would
    have to go through fierce battles against humans, goblins, giants, dwarves, and
    orcs. What none expected was that you and you alone would bring a sparring sword
    with a blunt edge. All goblin warriors knew of you well and gave up without fighting.
    The dwarves on the other hand figured they had a chance with their sturdy axes,
    but alas, they were too slow. Orcs, ferocious as they are charged immediately
    upon stepping foot in the arena, but a quick side-step and foot in front of the
    front-line\u2019s path made him fall, which in turn led to the rest falling over
    just the same.  <br><br> The final battle was a lone giant, not because there
    were few of them, but because the arena simply could not fit more. His huge fist
    soared through the air, but to your surprise it changed its trajectory at the
    last second, instead hitting the sand with full force. As the giant began to
    run, he tripped on his own foot and fell to the ground next to you. With a soft
    tone and tear-filled eyes he said, \u201CPlease, I didn\u2019t want to fight
    anyone in the first place. I had hoped you would give up as soon as I entered,
    like my opponents before you, but you stood your ground even as my fist was about
    to hit. Boy, that was scary... If you pretend to beat me I will give you a crystal
    I stored away.\u201D <br>You gladly accepted the deal, jumped on top of his back
    and proclaimed victory. </b> "
