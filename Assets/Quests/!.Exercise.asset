    for quite a while now, you thought you had encountered all there is to see. That
    is, until the night you awoke to the sound of what seemed to be a bell, lightly
    jingling outside your window. As you looked outside you could see a dim light,
    seemingly flying in circles just a few meters away from the inn.  <br><br> Now
    outside, you realised the thing you saw was in fact a fae. Judging by the jingling
    you quickly presumed that it was beckoning for you to follow. She stayed neither
    no close, nor too far away from you as she guided you across ancient bridges
    and through groves bustling with fireflies. There was only a feeling of awe -
    awe that this world you had gotten used to seeing everyday still had so many
    wonders left to be seen. Before you knew it, the fae was nowhere to be seen.
    Your mere surroundings had been enough to enchant you, but now it was time to
    go home.  <br><br> As you went to bed, you felt something in your right-most
    pocket\u2026 As you pulled it out you saw a crystal shimmering in the moonlight
    that the window provided you. \u201CSurely a gift from the fae\u201D, you thought
    as sleep once more embraced you. </b> "
