  rewardText: "<b>During your wanders, you\u2019ve seen peculiar locations a plenty,
    but few as strange as one of the rivers that flowed out into the waterfall... 
    <br><br> It had been a long time since you had cleaned your equipment, and you
    just so happened to be next to a clear river. Your armour and sword clanked as
    they hit the ground. It had been many hours since you last took them off, so
    the feeling of relief as the fresh air cooled your warm body was more than welcome.
    The cuirass was the first to be cleaned, as rust had started to bite into the
    upper section after a few days of rain. A light layer of golden brown floated
    to the surface as it was submerged. At first the assumption could be made that
    it was dirt, but once you brought the cuirass up again, no rust could be seen
    at all. In fact, the dents and scratches were completely gone too! It didn\u2019t
    take long until every piece of gear had been submerged with the same result.
    Finally, you took out an empty flask and filled it with water. Once morning came
    the day after you took the flask out of your bag, but there was now nothing but
    a slightly damp crystal inside. You tried finding the river again, but there
    wasn\u2019t a trace of it ever being there. </b> "
