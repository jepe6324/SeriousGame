  rewardText: At the harsh volcano, you see some salamanders who's scales have been
    stained with oil. They look like they are trying to scrape it off on a rock.
    Feeling empathic you lean walk up to the creatures and help them clean themselves
    up. After they are clean they scurry away quickly, after a while they return
    with a gem in.
