  questDescription: Try a new dish
  rewardPoints: 2
  rewardText: "<b>The Day of the Feast had come once more, and the villagers were
    beginning to come together. Some came with rice, others with fish, beef, or vegetables.
    Before you knew it, all the town\u2019s kitchens and campfires were used for
    cooking dishes you had never seen. Song and play made the atmosphere progressively
    livelier as the pleasant aromas filled the evening air. Many of these creatures
    were clearly not of the world you came from, which made you all the more curious
    about what they were making. A few hours and several taste-tests later, the main
    dishes were finally done. You spared no time in trying as much as you could,
    and every time your taste-buds came in contact with something new, the thought
    that nothing could ever taste better came up, until each new dish that is. <br><br>
    Full and satisfied, you eventually wrapped some of your favourites into a bag
    for future travels. The sun had long gone down and it was time to go to bed.
    One your way you heard the whimpering of a nearby dog, and soon thereafter you
    saw a dog leashed to a signpost. You realised she must\u2019ve been forgotten
    amongst the town bustling, likely without food. You revealed your bag of food,
    opened it up and left it next to her. The whimpering immediately stopped and
    was replaced by tail wagging. But\u2026 before the food was devoured she barked
    towards the signpost, and behind it you saw a crystal. You gladly accepted the
    payment and went on your way. </b> "
