  rewardText: "<b>You didn\u2019t know how long you had wandered through the drylands,
    but you were desperate to get out as soon as possible. Your steps eventually
    slowed down as fatigue set in, but even with your head held low you wandered.
    That is until you finally stepped on something immediately recognisable: grass.
    There was greenery as far as your eyes could see, the perfect duality to the
    dry wastes you arrived from. Hope finally came back and your pace increased.
    Your eyes darted left and right, a river, the bank of a sea, or even a puddle
    of water was all you desired.  <br><br> Suddenly: there it was, a huge grove
    unlike anything you had ever seen, with a lake surrounded by lush spruces. You
    spared no time in rushing down, dunking head first into the cold surface of the
    water. With no consideration for your breath you drank and drank. Never had you
    had water as good as from this lake: cold - but not chilly, deep - but not frightening.
    Suddenly, something touched your hand. At first you leaped back, but you soon
    saw the familiar shape of a crystal. At the lake\u2019s bottom was a stretching
    light, not unlike the crystal that had risen to the surface. You considered diving
    in to grab more, but you reconsidered at the thought that the crystals might
    be the source of the water-quality, and didn\u2019t dare take that away from
    the animals that might need the lake to live. Finally, your wander could continue.
